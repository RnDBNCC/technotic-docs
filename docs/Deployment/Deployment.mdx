```

```

### Change the workflow of branch to production and define the version type

```
Version Type [major | minor | patch]
Major: Big updates such as design changes
Minor: Add new features
Patch: Fix bug components such as margin, colour
```

Then click <b> run workflow </b> and wait for a second

It will be commited in production branch as <b> Automated Bump Version (updated version) </b>

## Merge and Pull Request
Last step is to <b> merge manually from the production branch to the master branch </b> by creating a pull request, which will update the master branch to the latest commit

<b> Check the version of Technotic at https://www.npmjs.com/package/technotic. </b> If the version has been updated, it means the deployment was successful
