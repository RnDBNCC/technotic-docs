Here are the steps that must be followed to set up and install Technotic

## Commands

#### Before using Technotic, make sure your node version is around 14.0.0. Otherwise, you can't setup Technotic
##### Download node from this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VguQtvCIjNksiAqY_obguCRn4HTgwlJ2/view?usp=sharing

<br/>

Clone technotic's repository, use:

```
git clone https://github.com/RnDBNCC/technotic.git
```

Don't forget to create react app, use:
```
npx create-react-app [name]
```

#### Make sure those 2 components are in the same folder.

## Installation

Change directory to technotic's folder, then setup Technotic:

```
npm install # or npm i
```

Copy your Technotic's Folder Path and paste in React's terminal to connect Technotic and React App:

```
npm install "[path]" # or npm i "[path]"

// Example

npm i "file:///C:\\Users\\Joshua Jevon Irawan\\Documents\\BNCCDesignSystem\\technotic"

```

Run Technotic, use:

```
npm run start
```

Run React App, use:

```
npm start
```

#### By using ```run start``` command (or ```run watch```), it will automatically update or rebuild in react when you make changes.
