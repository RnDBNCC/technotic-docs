## Introduction

A button is a specific type of user interface element used in web development to provide interactivity and trigger actions when clicked or activated. It is a graphical element that is typically styled with visual cues to indicate its purpose and can be customized to fit the overall design system of a website or application.

Buttons are essential components of a button design system and are used for various purposes such as submitting a form, navigating between pages, triggering specific functions or operations, and providing calls to action for users. They can be designed with different sizes, shapes, colors, and styles to create visual hierarchy and convey different levels of importance or urgency.

Button design systems help maintain consistency and coherence throughout a website or application by providing a set of predefined styles, guidelines, and components for creating buttons. This ensures that buttons across different pages and sections of the interface have a unified look and feel, enhancing the overall user experience and promoting intuitive interaction.
